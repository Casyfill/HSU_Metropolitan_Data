# 3.4 Data-driven decisions

Ekaterina Serova

The value of any data is estimated by the effect it makes on our plans and decisions. Therefore, the skill of using the most of data. The lecture covers the main approaches of optimization and risk modeling with the use of modern computational tools.

•	Optimization and efficiency frontier
•	Stochastic modeling and risk management 
•	Simulation and Monte-Carlo approaches
•	Application in urban management


## Educational Formats
•	lectures 
•	seminar 
•	student blog 

## Practical assignment

Students will be required to:

- solve a set of optimization problems
- in groups, define an urban optimization/risk problem for Moscow, and make an attempt to solve it, using data and information available
