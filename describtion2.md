The course provides a general overview of the field of urban informatics for designers and researchers with no technical background. It focuses on the large spectrum of technological applications and the analysis of their impact on urban environment, covering six different domains:

- Speculative Design 
- Complexity and the science of cities 
- Smart cities 
- Spontaneous data 
- Data-driven decision, stochastic modeling and risk management 
- Data Science 

While covering quite a wide set of topics, Metropolitan Data introduces all of them in broad strokes and offers guidelines for further investigation of the technological revolution, that reshapes the way contemporary cities work and grow.
