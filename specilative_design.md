# 3.1 Specilative design

*Philipp Kats*, *Ekaterina Serova*

Speculative design is a contemporary design movement which works with (towards) possible technological and social challenges, rather than reacting to existing ones. As technology rapidly changes the world around us, often changing things we least expect to be affected, this approach is useful for estimation of the effects of the future innovations and technical solutions to city problems.

- Innovation and innovation cycle 
- How technology shapes the city; direct and indirect ways 
- Speculative design and critical engineering 

### Educational Formats
- Lectures 
- Seminar 
- Problem set 
- Student blog 


### Practical Assignment
Students will be required to:
- In groups, select a topic and create a coherent slide show presentation (speculation) over potential ways particular technology might affect cities.
- create a blog post, covering presentation
